# Privacy Policy for Tab Relay

**Last updated: February 07, 2026**

Tab Relay ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and discloses information about you.

## 1. Information We Collect

Tab Relay is designed to operate locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, browsing history, or tab information to any external servers or third parties.

### Tab Data
The extension accesses your tab data (URLs and titles) solely for the purpose of:
- Creating tab groups.
- Saving tab groups to your local browser storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
- Copying tab groups to your clipboard (at your request).
- Generating export files (at your request).

This data remains on your device or in your personal clipboard/files. We do not have access to it.

### Clipboard Data
When you use the "Paste" feature, the extension reads data from your clipboard to restore tab groups. This data is processed locally and is not sent anywhere.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the information solely to provide the extension's core functionality:
- **Managing Tabs:** To organize, group, and restore tabs as requested.
- **Storage:** To save your groups locally so you can access them later.
- **Syncing (Manual):** To allow you to transfer groups between browsers via clipboard or file export.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to third parties. Your data stays on your machine.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy and, where appropriate, through the extension.
